# GitHub pages

In this exercise, we will create a `gh-pages` branch and add client-side website. Your site will be live at `https://<your github username>.github.io/learning-git/`. You can check out this [Static Site Generators](https://staticsitegenerators.net/). As we are learning Python in this class, we will create our static web with [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/).
