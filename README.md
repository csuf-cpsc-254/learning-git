# git add and git commit

The `git add` command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area, while the `git commit` command commits the staged snapshot to project history. In this exercise, we will fix up `word_count.py` python file using `with` block to open file more safely, add a small test text file to test that function, and commit these changes.
